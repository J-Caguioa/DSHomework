## Codebook for Live Session 5 Assignment
***

Instructions per assignment:

> Push at minimum your RMarkdown for this homework assignment and a Codebook to one of your GitHub repositories (you might place this in a Homework repo like last week).  The Codebook should contain a short definition of each object you create, and if creating multiple files, which file it is contained in.  You are welcome and encouraged to add other filesâ€”just make sure you have a description and directions that are helpful for the grader.

***
### Source Code
***

The two input files of raw data provided by the client, yob2015.txt and yob2016.txt, are comma-delimited tables of three unnamed columns. It is possible they were obtained from an [online database](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/) of popular baby names. The columns are labeled as follows:

* Name: A first name. A factor of varying levels.
* Gender: Sex assigned at birth. A factor of two levels, female (F) and male (M).
* Births_201{y}: Amount of children (of a specified gender) given a name for a specified year. {y} represents the year's ending digit, 5 for 2015 and 6 for 2016. An integer.

***
### All Objects
***

The following objects, listed in order of appearance in JCaguioa_LiveSession5Assignment, are used to obtain the tidy dataset.

* df: Dataframe holding raw yob2016.txt input.
* aWeirdName: A misspelled, redundant name.
* y2016: Cleaned version of df.
* y2015: Dataframe holding yob2015.txt input.
* y2015_2: Dataframe for intermediate merging step where Name and Gender are united to create a shared column of unique values.
* y2016_2: Dataframe for intermediate merging step where Name and Gender are united to create a shared column of unique values.
* both_years: Merged version of y2015_2 and y2016_2.
* final: Dataframe with cleaned and merged versions of yob2015.txt and yob2016.txt.

The following objects, listed in order of appearance in JCaguioa_LiveSession5Assignment, are used to answer questions of interest.

* popular_named_kids: Integer showing how many total babies received popular names.
* sorted_final: Sorted version of final showing most popular names.
* sorted_girls: Subsetted version of sorted_final showing most popular names for only girls.
* top_ten_girls: Dataframe subsetted from sorted_girls with top ten popular girl names and their totals in 2015 and 2016.

***
### Final Dataset
***

The final tidy dataset, final, includes five variables. Further sorting and subsetting are performed to answer specific questions, but the variables remain the same.

* Name
* Gender
* Births_2015
* Births_2016
* Total: Amount of children given a name for 2015 and 2016 combined. An integer.

The following variables were created in going from raw to tidy data:

Variable Name   | Class     | In Final?
:-------------- | :-------: | :--------:
Name            | Factor    | Yes
Gender          | Factor    | Yes
NameGender      | Character | No
Births_2015     | Integer   | Yes
Births_2016     | Integer   | Yes
Total           | Integer   | Yes

A subsetted version of final, top_ten_girls, is outputted into top_girl_names.csv.

### Code for Tidy Dataset
***

```{r tidyup, eval = FALSE}

# Tidy variable names, clean y2016.
colnames(df) <- c("Name", "Gender", "Births_2016")
y2016 <- data.frame(df[df$Name != 'Fionayyy', ])
colnames(y2015) <- c("Name", "Gender", "Births_2015")

# Merge dataframes into final and create Total column.
y2015_2 <- unite(y2015, NameGender, c(Name, Gender), remove = TRUE)
y2016_2 <- unite(y2016, NameGender, c(Name, Gender), remove = TRUE)
both_years <- merge(y2015_2, y2016_2, by = "NameGender", all = FALSE)
final <- separate(both_years, col = "NameGender", into = c("Name", "Gender"), sep = "_", remove = TRUE)
final$Total <- final$Births_2015 + final$Births_2016

```
